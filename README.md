# **Introduction**


Portfolio Project 2 - Code Institute Full Stack Development Diploma

WeatherWise is a Python-based command line application that offers current, daily and historic weather insights based on the user's location. The application utilises API to retrieve up-to-date accurate weather data and runs via a mock terminal on Heroku. JSON is used in this project to retrieve, parse and present weather API data to the user.

WeatherWise was designed as an ultra-efficient solution for users who require access to weather information at a moments notice. The no-frills, data-driven interface eliminates elements typical of a traditional weather info site which can hinder data delivery speed and negatively impact the user expierience, such as: ads, slow-loading graphics, unrelated content, cookies and complex navigation menus.

Deployed website can be be found here:

## **User Experience - UX**

### **User Stories**

As a user, I wish to:

- Immediately understand the purpose of the application, so I can quickly determine if it meets my needs.
- Receive clear feedback on invalid inputs, so I can quickly correct my entries and proceed with using the application.
- Input my country and city easily, so I can get localized weather information relevant to my area.
- View the current weather forecast, so I can plan my immediate activities accordingly.
- See the daily weather forecast, so I can plan my week and make informed decisions about upcoming events.
- Be notified of any national weather alerts, so I can stay safe and prepared for potential severe weather conditions.
- Access historical weather data, so I can compare current conditions with past trends and make long-term plans.
- Use a simple and intuitive interface, so I can navigate the application easily without needing extensive instructions.

As a developer, I wish to: 

- Access a README file so that I can understand the scope and purpose of the project and locate essential information regarding the application
- Access deployment information so I can follow step-by-step instructions on how to deploy the project
